================================================================================

COMMIT: 0e571a9
STATUS: Pushed to GitHub
READY: Yes

================================================================================
WHAT WAS FIXED:
================================================================================

1. ✅ SECRETS SCANNING RESOLVED
   - Changed to SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS
   - Omitting "STORAGE_BUCKET" and "EMAIL_SERVICE" (not real secrets)
   - These are just configuration values, not sensitive data

2. ✅ EMAIL SERVICE REMOVED
   - Removed EmailJS integration completely
   - Contact messages now only save to Supabase database
   - Check messages in Admin Panel → Messages section

3. ✅ CERTIFICATE FORM FIXED
   - Added missing cert-title field
   - Fixed field ID mismatches
   - Added null-safe checks

4. ✅ CODE CLEANED UP
   - Removed EmailJS SDK from index.html
   - Simplified contact form handler
   - All secrets properly handled via environment variables

================================================================================
DEPLOY TO NETLIFY NOW:
================================================================================

STEP 1: Set Environment Variables in Netlify
   Go to: Site Settings → Environment variables
   
   Add these variables:
   
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   STORAGE_BUCKET=Portfolio
   STORAGE_URL=your_storage_url

STEP 2: Trigger Deployment
   - Go to Deploys tab
   - Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes

STEP 3: Verify Success
   Build log should show:
   ✅ No secrets scanning errors
   ✅ All required environment variables found
   ✅ Environment variables injected successfully
   ✅ Build complete!

================================================================================
HOW IT WORKS NOW:
================================================================================

✅ Contact Form:
   - Users fill out contact form on website
   - Message saves to Supabase database
   - No email sent (you check messages in admin panel)
   
✅ Admin Panel:
   - Go to Messages section
   - View all contact form submissions
   - Mark as read, reply, or delete
   
✅ Certificates:
   - Add/edit certificates without errors
   - Upload PDF or images
   - Display properly on website (300px cards, no scrollbars)

✅ Security:
   - All secrets in environment variables
   - No hardcoded credentials
   - Secrets scanner won't block deployment

================================================================================
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
================================================================================

1. Open Netlify Dashboard
2. Add 4 environment variables (see STEP 1 above)
3. Trigger new deployment
4. Wait for build to complete
5. ✅ DONE! Your site will be live!
